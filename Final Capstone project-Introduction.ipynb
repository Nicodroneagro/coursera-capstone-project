There are a lot of parmeters to take into account in order to succeed to run a new businness. The food, service but also the location have to be choosen in a meaningful way in order to establish a productive bussiness. The location of the restaurant should take into account different parameters like parking availability, visiblity and neighborhood competition. With Foursquare location data, it will be possible to recommand a specific location adapted to a new restaurant opening."
